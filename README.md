## Create a project in react 

Use the next command: 

#### `npx create-react-app name`

Move all the files and folders to the repository 

#### `Move the archives to the repository` 

Then you can erase the folder that is empty.  

In the next steps you need to create folders for all the project:

## Folders

* assets

In this folder you can add multimedia like images, styles, css, etc.

* components

In this folder you can create new personalize components to use in all the project.

* constants

In this folder you can add constants that you can use in all the project

* hooks

In this folder you can create use personalize hooks to use in all the project

* layouts

In this folder you can create personalize layouts to use in all the project


In the folder of redux: 

* redux

Redux allow to modifying a state from anywhere in the code when is correctly configured.

- You need to create another folders in the folder of redux:

* slices

In this folder we save all the states  

* store

In another hand this folder is connected to the global states

Then we can doing the creation of another folders:

* services

This folders is used to storage the services that we can consume of a third parts or entities

* theme

This folder is destined to storage the framework to use in the views or the Interface

* utils

This folder contains functions that I created and I will reused

* views

Finally in this folder I can find the views of the project, the structure. 

So after that we do all this steps, we can go to the rest of files of src and we need just the files:

#### `App.js`
#### `index.js`

All the rest of files we can erase.
